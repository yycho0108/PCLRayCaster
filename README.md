# PCL Ray Caster
=======

Yoonyoung (Jamie) Cho

Toy implementation of a ray caster in PCL.

Note that the surface characteristics of the provided mesh is disregarded;

i.e. for the purposes of the caster, it is merely considered as a point cloud.

Currently implemented using an Octree, along with a sample moving scene just for fun.
